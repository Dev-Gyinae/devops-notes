Introduction
Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. In this guide, we will:

Install Ansible on a primary server (Control Node).
Configure SSH access to a secondary server (Managed Node).
Test connectivity using Ansible.

Prerequisites
Control Node: A Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS) where Ansible will be installed.
Managed Node: A secondary Linux server that Ansible will manage.
SSH Access: The control node must have SSH access to the managed node.

Step 1: Install Ansible on the Control Node
#Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible 

#CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y ansible

#Verify Installation:
ansible --version
Step 2: Configure SSH Key Authentication
Ansible requires passwordless SSH access to the managed node.

Generate an SSH Key on Control Node

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ansible_key
Copy the public key to managed Node(s)

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub user@managed_node_ip

#Replace user with the remote username and managed_node_ip with the server’s IP.
Test SSH Access

ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key user@managed_node_ip
Step 3: Set Up Ansible Inventory
Ansible uses an inventory file to define managed hosts.

Create an inventory File

mkdir -p ~/ansible/inventory
nano ~/ansible/inventory/hosts
Add the following (replace managed_node_ip with your server’s IP):

[web_servers]
managed_node_ip ansible_user=user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible_key
ansible_user: The SSH user on the managed node.

ansible_ssh_private_key_file: Path to the private key.

Step 4: Test Ansible Connectivity
Ping the Managed Node:

ansible -i ~/ansible/inventory/hosts all -m ping
Expected outcome:

managed_node_ip | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Step 5: Run an Ad-Hoc Command (Optional)
Execute a command on the managed node:

ansible -i ~/ansible/inventory/hosts all -m command -a "uptime"
Conclusion
You have successfully:

Installed Ansible on the control node.
Configured SSH key-based authentication.
Set up an inventory file.
Tested connectivity to the managed node.
